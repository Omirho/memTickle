1. Install CLion
1. Open project. Build and run project.
1. I have already written some basic tests in main.cpp. A proper testing framework could have been used.
1. MemoryManager has 3 functions:
    * allocate(Process, Size)
    * free(Process)
    * showMemoryFootprint(Process)

1. Process has 1 function:
    * write(String)

All functions and classes are commented.
Tests can be viewed as examples.
